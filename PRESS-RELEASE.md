# Joseki #
 
## Command and control for the every day person ##
Social engagement solution that spontaneously builds, organizes, and drives events for organizers and participants.

## Summary ##
Joseki is a social community tool that allows people to organize and participate in events. The simple user interface
makes it easy for a user to either organize large complex events or for a user to find and participate in large events.
Ease comes from a graphical interface for organizers and participants, and a real-time communication network. The network
allows participants to relay information directly to organizers and for organizers to send commands and notifications
to the participants. 

## Problem ##
It takes a lot of preparation and work to organize and run large events. It's hard for participants and organizers to
communicate during the event.

## Solution ##
Joseki bridges the communication gap during the event and displays real-time, relevant information to organizers and
participants. This allows organizers to act on an unexpected event. It includes the following features:

- Top-down visibility of events in the area for both organizers and participants
- Organizers can send notifications directly to participants
- Participants can record real-time observations on the events
- Shared map interface between organizers and participants
