# Rallie #
 
## Find and host events supported by real-time collaboration ##

## Summary ##
Rallie is a platform that makes creating and hosting events easier. It closes
the communication gap between hosts and participants so they can collaborate on
those events in real-time and rally together.

## Problem ##
Typically, this is hard; it is difficult to manage uncertainty. Event hosts put
a great deal of effort into ensuring an event runs smoothly. Participants are
not willing to get involved without a clear understanding of what’s going on.
Once something unexpected happens, all hell could break loose. When
participants and hosts can seamlessly share information, hosts can act and
direct participants to respond accordingly.

## Solution ##
Rallie allows users to log in through Facebook to find or create events. When
users participate in an event, they can record their observations with text and
images immediately. These observations are shared within the event so everyone
is aware of what’s happening.

Additionally, users can create and host an event by simply defining the name,
location, time, and activity. During an event, event hosts can leverage the
live observation feed to make informed decisions and immediately notify
participants of actions to take.
